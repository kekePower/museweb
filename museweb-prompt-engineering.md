# MuseWeb Prompt Engineering Guide

> **Who is this guide for?** This guide is designed for content creators, web developers, and technical marketers who want to leverage MuseWeb effectively. While no coding experience is required, basic familiarity with HTML concepts and Markdown will help you get the most out of this guide. [If you're new to HTML or Markdown, consider reviewing these fundamentals first](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML).

## Introduction: The Art of Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting instructions that effectively guide AI language models to produce desired outputs. In the context of MuseWeb, it's the fundamental skill that determines the quality, consistency, and effectiveness of your generated web pages.

Good prompt engineering is critical for several reasons:

1. **Deterministic Results**: Well-crafted prompts produce more predictable and consistent outputs, reducing the need for multiple generations or extensive editing.

2. **Efficiency**: Clear, focused prompts help the AI model understand your intent quickly, reducing token usage and generation time.

3. **Quality Control**: Structured prompts with explicit constraints help prevent common AI pitfalls like hallucinations, off-topic content, or stylistic inconsistencies.

4. **Personality and Brand Consistency**: Properly engineered prompts maintain a consistent voice, tone, and style across your entire site, reinforcing your brand identity.

5. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Thoughtful prompt engineering can ensure your content meets accessibility standards and avoids biased or exclusionary language.

In essence, the prompts you write become the DNA of your MuseWeb site. Mastering prompt engineering transforms MuseWeb from a novelty into a powerful, production-ready publishing platform.

## How MuseWeb Uses Prompts

> **Note:** For a technical overview of MuseWeb's architecture, see the [README.md](README.md). This section focuses specifically on prompt engineering strategies.

MuseWeb uses a layered prompt approach that gives you precise control over different aspects of your site. Each layer has a specific purpose and best practices:

### The Prompt Cascade: Engineering Each Layer

1. **System Prompt** (`system_prompt.txt`)
   - **Purpose:** Establishes the foundational rules and identity
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Keep it concise but comprehensive (300-500 words)
     - Clearly define your brand voice and personality
     - Include non-negotiable structural requirements
     - Specify technical constraints (accessibility, semantic HTML)
   - **NEVER DO THIS:** 
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** overload with design details that belong in `layout.txt`
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** include temporary or test content that might accidentally go live
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** contradict yourself with conflicting directives

2. **Layout Prompt** (`layout.txt`) - *Optional*
   - **Purpose:** Controls visual design and interactive elements
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Define a clear color palette with semantic variable names
     - Specify typography with fallbacks
     - Create reusable component patterns
     - Include accessibility requirements explicitly (these are NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - **NEVER DO THIS:**
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** include page-specific content instructions
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** let marketing or design preferences override accessibility requirements
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** include complex JavaScript without security review

3. **Page Prompt** (`[page_name].txt`)
   - **Purpose:** Defines specific content for each page
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Structure with clear headings and sections
     - Be specific about content requirements
     - Use examples where helpful
     - Keep focused on content, not design
   - **NEVER DO THIS:**
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** include business logic or random JavaScript—keep that in layout or system
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** contradict system-level directives
     - ⛔ **DO NOT** duplicate design instructions that belong in layout prompt

### Prompt Evolution: Iterative Improvement

Effective prompt engineering is iterative. Here's a real example showing how a page prompt evolves:

**Iteration 1 (Too vague):**
```
Create an about page for my tech company.
```

**Result:** Generic content, inconsistent with brand voice, missing key sections.

**Iteration 2 (Better structure):**
```
# About Page

Create an about page with these sections:
- Company history
- Team
- Mission
- Values
```

**Result:** Improved structure but still generic content.

**Iteration 3 (Specific guidance):**
```
# About Page

Create an about page with these sections:

## Our Story
- Founded in 2018 by former cybersecurity experts
- Pivoted to privacy-focused consumer tools in 2020
- Now serving over 50,000 users globally

## Our Mission
- Focus on our commitment to "Privacy as a Human Right"
- Mention our open-source contributions

## Our Team
- Feature our leadership team (use placeholder names)
- Highlight diverse backgrounds and expertise

## Our Values
- Transparency
- User Control
- Innovation
- Accessibility
```

**Result:** Specific, on-brand content with the right structure and details.

This layered, iterative approach allows you to maintain consistency while giving each page the specific attention it needs.

## Markdown: The Secret Weapon for Better Results

> **Pro Tip:** While MuseWeb's output is always HTML, using Markdown syntax within your prompts often leads to better results.

### HTML vs. Markdown: A Comparison

Let's compare the same prompt written in HTML-style vs. Markdown-style:

**HTML-Style Prompt (Harder to write and read):**
```
Create a page with <h1>About Our Company</h1> and then add <p>Founded in 2020, we specialize in...</p>
<h2>Our Services</h2>
<ul>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Mobile Apps</li>
<li>Cloud Solutions</li>
</ul>
```

**Markdown-Style Prompt (Cleaner and more natural):**
```
Create a page with

# About Our Company

Founded in 2020, we specialize in...

## Our Services

- Web Development
- Mobile Apps
- Cloud Solutions
```

**The Result:** The Markdown-style prompt typically produces cleaner, more semantic HTML output because:
1. It's easier for the AI to understand the hierarchical structure
2. It reduces the chance of malformed HTML tags
3. It allows the AI to apply its own best practices for HTML generation

### Benefits of Markdown in Prompts

1. **Clarity and Readability**: Markdown is inherently more readable than HTML, making your prompts easier to write, understand, and maintain.

2. **Structural Guidance**: Markdown's simple heading structure (`#`, `##`, `###`) provides clear hierarchical cues to the AI about content organization.

3. **Emphasis Without Verbosity**: Markdown's concise syntax for emphasis (`*italic*`, `**bold**`) communicates intent without cluttering your prompts.

4. **List Formatting**: Markdown's simple list syntax (`-` or `1.`) helps the AI understand and maintain proper list structures in the generated HTML.

5. **Natural Writing Flow**: Markdown allows you to write in a more natural, human way while still conveying structural intent.

### Implementation Tips

- Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to clearly delineate sections in your prompts
- Utilize bullet points (`-`) and numbered lists (`1.`) to organize related items
- Employ emphasis markers (`*italic*`, `**bold**`) to highlight key terms or requirements
- Include code blocks with triple backticks for any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript snippets you want to reference
- Remember that the AI will convert your Markdown-style instructions into proper HTML in the final output

## Troubleshooting: When the AI Gets It Wrong

> **Don't Panic!** Even well-crafted prompts can sometimes produce unexpected results. Here's how to fix common issues.

### Quick Debug Checklist

When your generated page isn't what you expected, run through this checklist:

✅ **Is the AI hallucinating?**  
→ Add "Use ONLY the facts provided. DO NOT invent additional information."

✅ **Is it spitting out garbage HTML?**  
→ Use Markdown headings and lists instead of hand-rolled HTML.

✅ **Is the design inconsistent?**  
→ Check your layout prompt for missing CSS or conflicting directives.

✅ **Are you getting accessibility errors?**  
→ Ensure your requirements are explicit in the layout prompt.

✅ **Is the content repetitive or fluffy?**  
→ Add "Be concise. Avoid filler words and repetition."

✅ **Is the tone wrong?**  
→ Specify voice explicitly: "Write in a [professional/casual/technical] tone."

### Common AI Pitfalls and Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Hallucinations** | Made-up facts, products, or team members | Explicitly state "Use only the facts provided. Do not invent additional information." |
| **Repetitive Content** | Same phrases or concepts repeated multiple times | Add "Avoid repetition. Each paragraph should contain unique information." |
| **Inconsistent Voice** | Tone shifts between formal/casual or between sections | Define voice clearly in system prompt: "Maintain a consistent [formal/casual/technical] tone throughout." |
| **Off-Topic Content** | AI wanders into unrelated subjects | Structure prompts with explicit sections and add "Stay focused on the topics outlined. Do not introduce unrelated subjects." |
| **Outdated Information** | References to old technologies or dates | Specify current year and technology context: "This content is for 2025. Reference current technologies like..." |

### Example: Fixing a Problematic Prompt

**Original Prompt (Problematic):**
```
Make a page about our AI services.
```

**Issues with this prompt:**
- Too vague, invites hallucination
- No structure guidance
- No constraints on tone or content

**The Bad Output:**

```html
<div class="ai-services">
  <h1>Our Revolutionary AI Services</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our cutting-edge AI solutions that are transforming industries worldwide! Our team of expert engineers has developed proprietary algorithms that deliver unparalleled results.</p>
  
  <div class="service-box">
    <h2>AI Chatbot Development</h2>
    <p>Our award-winning chatbots have served Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, increasing customer satisfaction by an average of 78%.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="service-box">
    <h2>Predictive Analytics</h2>
    <p>Our predictive models have 99.8% accuracy and have saved our clients over $50 million in operational costs.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="testimonial">
    <blockquote>"This team revolutionized our entire business model with their AI solutions!"</blockquote>
    <cite>- John Smith, CEO of TechGiant Industries</cite>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Problems with this output:**
- Completely fabricated services (the company doesn't develop chatbots)
- Made-up clients (Microsoft, Google, Amazon)
- Invented statistics (78% satisfaction, 99.8% accuracy)
- Fake testimonial from a non-existent person and company
- Generic, hyperbolic language ("revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "transforming industries")

**Improved Prompt:**
```

```

### Version Control and Operational Hygiene

> **Critical Practice:** Prompt engineering without version control is like coding without a safety net.

**Always follow these practices:**

1. **Store all prompts in version control** (e.g., Git)
   - This is not optional—it's basic operational hygiene
   - When something breaks, you can roll back and see what changed
   - Enables collaboration and review processes

2. **Use clear version naming conventions**
   - Format: `[page]_v[number].txt` (e.g., `about_v2.txt`)
   - Include brief commit messages describing what changed
   - Tag major releases for easy reference

3. **Document changes and reasoning**
   - Keep a changelog of major prompt modifications
   - Note which changes fixed specific issues
   - Record successful patterns for reuse

4. **Implement a review process**
   - Never push prompt changes directly to production
   - Have another team member review significant changes
   - Test prompts in a staging environment first

### Performance and Cost Considerations

> **Warning:** Longer prompts and more iterations burn more tokens and cost more money.

Prompt engineering has real resource implications:

1. **Token Economy**
   - Every word in your prompt costs tokens (and potentially money)
   - Extremely verbose prompts can become expensive at scale
   - Balance detail with efficiency

2. **Avoid Over-Engineering**
   - Don't add unnecessary constraints or examples
   - Focus on what matters for the specific page
   - Remember the law of diminishing returns

3. **Measure and Optimize**
   - Track token usage across different prompt versions
   - Identify patterns that use tokens efficiently
   - Consider caching common responses

### Security and Abuse Considerations

> **Warning:** When accepting user-generated prompts, be aware of potential security risks.

**Best Practices:**

1. **Never** allow arbitrary JavaScript injection through prompts
2. **Validate** all user-supplied content before using it in prompts
3. **Limit** the ability of public users to modify system or layout prompts
4. **Monitor** for attempts to override security constraints
5. **Consider** running the generated HTML through a sanitizer if accepting public prompt contributions

### Enforcing Accessibility

> **Accessibility is not optional. It's the law in many jurisdictions—and the right thing to do.**

Accessibility failures can lead to legal action, damaged reputation, and most importantly, exclude people from using your site. Add these explicit requirements to your layout prompt:

```
## Accessibility Requirements (MANDATORY)

- All images MUST include descriptive alt text
- Color contrast MUST meet WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Interactive elements MUST be keyboard accessible
- Use semantic HTML elements (nav, main, section, article) appropriately
- Form inputs MUST have associated labels
- Use ARIA roles and attributes where appropriate
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Provide visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation
```

**Validation is Essential:**

Don't just trust the AI to get accessibility right. Use automated tools to validate the generated HTML:

- [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [HTML5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Remember: No prompt will fix a fundamentally inaccessible design. Accessibility must be built into your system from the ground up.

## Prompt Patterns Library
