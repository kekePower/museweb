Instruct the AI to write a short think-piece covering these themes:
-   **Sustainable Infrastructure:** How self-hosting and owning your hardware is a sustainable practice, freeing you from reliance on ephemeral cloud services.
-   **Sustainable Knowledge:** How sharing open, honest guides and scripts creates a sustainable ecosystem for the community, allowing others to build and learn.
-   **Sustainable Code:** The philosophy of writing simple, maintainable tools (for example, a lightweight static site generator) that are built to last and be understood, rather than complex, disposable software.
