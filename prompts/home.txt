Generate the "Home" page for this technology blog. It should be engaging and inviting as the first page a visitor sees.

1.  **Hero Section:** Create a strong, concise hero section that immediately establishes the site's identity.
    * It MUST feature the main heading "kekePower".
    * It MUST include a powerful tagline that reflects the core identity, such as "Championing Mageia Linux, Packaging, and Open-Source Innovation."
    * The overall tone should be direct and welcoming to "curious humans who build, break, and explore."

2.  **Content Pillars:** Below the hero, the page should highlight the kind of content available (guides, scripts, honest thoughts).
    * Present these as three visually distinct sections or cards.
    * The design should incorporate soft, muted gradients as requested, making the page visually appealing.

3.  **Call To Action:** The page needs a unique Call To Action that tells the visitor to try reloading the page.
    * You can phrase it simply as "Try Reloading The Page. Just try it!"
    * **IMPORTANT:** If you create a button or a link for this CTA, it MUST link to "/" to ensure it triggers a page reload and demonstrates the dynamic nature of the site.
