Generate the "Home" page for this technology blog. Create a strong, concise hero section that immediately tells visitors what the site is about: local AI, Linux, self-hosting, and owning your tech. The tone should be direct and welcome "curious humans who build, break, and explore." The page should briefly highlight the kind of content available (guides, scripts, honest thoughts) and encourage exploration of the other sections.
