Generate a "What is This?" page that explains the philosophy and technology behind MuseWeb.

Key points to cover:
- MuseWeb is a high-performance web engine written in Go.
- It serves dynamic content generated by a large language model (like yourself).
- The "soul" of the website (its content, personality, and knowledge) lives entirely in simple text files located in the `prompts/` directory.
- This creates a powerful separation of concerns: the engine is the fast, reliable core, while the prompts are the easily editable "soul."
- This allows anyone, even non-programmers, to change the entire website just by editing text files.
- Frame this as a new paradigm for web development: "Prompt-Driven Websites."
