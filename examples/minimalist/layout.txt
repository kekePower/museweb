The layout is defined by `/style.css`. The structure should be semantic and simple.
- Use a `<main>` tag to wrap the primary content of the page.
- The page title should be an `<h1>`.
- Use `<h2>` for subheadings.
- Use `<p>` for paragraphs.
- The overall structure is a single, centered column for maximum readability.
