Forget modern layouts! This is pure 90s chaos.
- Center everything you can with the `<center>` tag.
- Use different font sizes and colors for every heading with the `<font size="..." color="...">` tag.
- Use animated GIFs as dividers (`<hr>`).
- The layout should feel cramped and busy. Tables for layout are encouraged if you want to get really authentic.
- Don't worry about semantics at all. This is about VIBES.
